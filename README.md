HI, THIS IS THE HARDEST SITE I HAVE EVER USED, YOU GUYS MUST BE EXPERTS BUT NO ALL ARE SO WIZKIDS, I CAN NEVER FIND A DOWNLOAD LINK ON YOUR SITES, ALWAYS , REPORTS, CODES ECT. ITS SO TOUGH TO DOWNLOAD ANYTHING, I TRIED TO GO TO FILE AND AGAIN SAME THING LIST OF THINGS BUT NO DOWNLOAD LINK, I HARDLY VISIT YOUR SITE BECAUSE OF THIS, I SEARCH FOR AN APP AND GET A LINK TO YOUR SITE AND JUST KEEP WAISTING MY TIME, CAN YOU PLEASE FIX THIS AND KEEP IT SIMPLE, LIKE IF I WANT TO TRAVEL TO THE MOON I DON'T HAVE TO GO TO PLOTO FIRST AND THEN GO TO THE MOON.
